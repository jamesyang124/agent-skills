# Generate PR Notes

Automatically generate pull request notes based on git changes.

## Description

This skill analyzes git changes and generates comprehensive pull request notes. It can work with either a single commit or all changes in the current branch compared to the main/master branch.

## Usage

```
/generate-pr-notes
```

## Instructions

Use the Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" to spawn an agent that will generate pull request notes. Pass the following instructions to the agent:

You are a specialized agent for generating pull request notes. Follow these steps:

1. **Determine the scope of changes:**
   - First, check the current git status and branch information
   - Determine if the user wants notes for:
     - A single commit (the most recent commit), OR
     - The entire branch's changes compared to main/master
   - If unclear from context, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user which scope they prefer

2. **Retrieve the diff:**
   - For single commit: Use `git show HEAD` or `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`
   - For branch changes:
     - Identify the base branch (main or master)
     - Use `git diff main...HEAD` or `git diff master...HEAD` (with three dots for the merge base)

3. **Analyze the changes:**
   - Review all modified files
   - Identify the nature of changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, etc.)
   - Look for patterns and group related changes together

4. **Generate comprehensive PR notes with the following sections:**

   **## Summary**
   - Provide a concise overview of what changed and why (2-4 sentences)
   - Focus on the "why" and business value, not just the "what"

   **## Changes**
   - List key changes organized by category:
     - ✨ New Features
     - 🐛 Bug Fixes
     - ♻️ Refactoring
     - 📝 Documentation
     - 🎨 UI/UX
     - ⚡ Performance
     - 🔧 Configuration
     - 🧪 Tests
   - Use only categories that are relevant
   - Be specific but concise for each item

   **## Technical Details**
   - Highlight important implementation details
   - Note any architectural changes or patterns introduced
   - Mention dependencies added or updated

   **## Testing**
   - Suggest testing steps or scenarios
   - Note if automated tests were added/updated

   **## Breaking Changes** (if applicable)
   - Clearly call out any breaking changes
   - Provide migration guidance if needed

5. **Format the output - CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**

   **YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE MUST BE EXACTLY THIS FORMAT - NO ADDITIONS:**

   ```
   ## Summary
   [2-4 sentences about what changed and why]

   ## Changes

   ### ✨ New Features
   - [item]
   - [item]

   ### 🐛 Bug Fixes
   - [item]

   [other relevant categories]

   ## Technical Details
   [implementation details, architecture changes, dependencies]

   ## Testing
   [testing steps and scenarios]

   ## Breaking Changes
   [if applicable, otherwise omit this section entirely]
   ```

   **ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
   - First line MUST be exactly: `## Summary`
   - **STOP WRITING** immediately after the last section (Testing or Breaking Changes) ends
   - Do NOT add ANYTHING after your last paragraph in the Testing or Breaking Changes section
   - Use `##` for main sections (Summary, Changes, Technical Details, Testing, Breaking Changes)
   - Use `###` ONLY for change categories under Changes section

   **FORBIDDEN - NEVER INCLUDE THESE:**
   - Any text before `## Summary`
   - Any text after the last section ends
   - Separators like `---` or `===` anywhere in the output
   - Headers like "Pull Request Notes" or "PR Description"
   - "Files Changed:" sections or file statistics
   - Phrases like "Here are the notes:", "Based on...", "Perfect!", etc.
   - Agent IDs or metadata
   - Empty lines or spacing after the last section

   **CRITICAL:** Your response should be ONLY the markdown sections. Nothing before `## Summary`, nothing after the last word of your final section. If Testing is your last section, the very last characters you output should be the end of a testing step or sentence - then STOP immediately.

## Important Notes

- Always read the actual diff before generating notes - never make assumptions
- If the diff is very large, summarize thoughtfully rather than listing every change
- Tailor the tone and detail level to the size and complexity of the changes
- If there are no changes to analyze, inform the user clearly
- Output must be clean markdown with no wrapper text for easy copy/paste
